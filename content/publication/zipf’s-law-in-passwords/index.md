abstract: Despite three decades of intensive research efforts, it remains an
  open question as to what is the underlying distribution of user-generated
  passwords. In this paper, we make a substantial step forward toward
  understanding this foundational question. By introducing a number of
  computational statistical techniques and based on 14 large-scale data sets,
  which consist of 113.3 million real-world passwords, we, for the first time,
  propose two Zipf-like models (i.e., PDF-Zipf and CDF-Zipf) to characterize the
  distribution of passwords. More specifically, our PDF-Zipf model can well fit
  the popular passwords and obtain a coefficient of determination larger than
  0.97; our CDF-Zipf model can well fit the entire password data set, with the
  maximum cumulative distribution function (CDF) deviation between the empirical
  distribution and the fitted theoretical model being 0.49%~4.59% (on an average
  1.85%). With the concrete knowledge of password distributions, we suggest a
  new metric for measuring the strength of password data sets. Extensive
  experimental results show the effectiveness and general applicability of the
  proposed Zipf-like models and security metric.
