abstract: Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) have been pro-posed to
  capture password distributions, and further been used in password guessing
  attacks and password strength meters. However, current PCFGs suffer from the
  limitation of inaccurate segmentation of password, which leads to
  misestimation of password probability and thus seriously affects their
  performance. In this paper, we propose a word extraction approach for
  passwords, and further present an improved PCFG model, called WordPCFG. The
  WordPCFG using word extraction method can precisely extract semantic segments
  (called word) from passwords based on cohesion and freedom of words. We
  evaluate our WordPCFG on six large-scale datasets, showing that WordPCFG
  cracks 83.04%–95.47% passwords and obtains 12.96%–71.84% improvement over the
  state-of-the-art PCFGs.
